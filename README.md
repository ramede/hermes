This is a fork of [gadabout/hermes](https://github.com/gadabout/hermes). 

It is a single view app designed for listing GitHub repositories using the API provided by the [GitHub Search API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search).
This iOS study covered essential foundations like MVVM architecture, View Code, UITableViewController, UISearchController, and GraphQL.

I decided to use the UIKit components to help me write a native experience for the user, thus avoiding reinventing the wheel. It's a simple solution but pretty cool to do. Graphql is so pretty, and Apollo helps us in this way.

To Do
- [ ] Create UI Tests
- [ ] Create ViewModel Unit Tests; 
- [ ] Saving repositories with stars using [Starring API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/activity/starring)

**Xcode Version**: 13.1\

**Swift Version**: 5
